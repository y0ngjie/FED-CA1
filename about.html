                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>My name is Yongjie, a 17 year old currently pursing a Diploma in Applied AI & Analytics in Singapore Polytechnic. Interstingly, I also have a sister that is also pursing the same Diploma in Y3!</p>
                <p>Personally, I enjoy having a laidback lifestyle, I love being able to wake up at anytime, preparing a relaxing morning coffee to get me ready for the day, while watching my favourite shows on my phone. </p>
                <p>I enjoy going to Sentosa's Beaches with my friends ocasionally, to relax among the waves and cycle along the coasts, it is one of my favourite activies that I look forward to every week! Other than that, I usually join my
                  SAJC friends in Ultimate Frisbee for their weekly Saturday throwing sessions.

                <p>Embracing laziness has been a refreshing aspect in my life, rather than a flaw, I view it as a break from the hectic student life, being lazy has allowed me to
                  relax and recharge myself.
                </p>
                <p>As a person, I tend to be more socialable compared to the average Joe and like to go out, to people and make new friends. I enjoy the challange of
                  having a difficult task done, as it pushes my to my limit, and usually I would go to the library and spend a long time trying before giving up. 
                </p>
                <p>But sometimes, I'd rather stay at home to enjoy a hot cup of coffee with
                  a few slices of bread while enjoying watching anime. In short, I would say that I am lazy, outgoing and hardworking.

            <article>
                <p>There are many values in the world and not everyone shares the same values. Some may feel that their values are stability, secuirty and excellence, others my feel that
                  their values are happiness and health. But my personal values are:</p>

                <h3>Being the Best</h3>
                <p>It never feels good being last, so why not strive to be the best? </p>
                
                <h3>Enjoyment</h3>
                <p> It is important to take breaks, have fun and enjoy life, if not it would be easy to burn out.
                </p>

                <h3>Hardworking</h3>
                <p>I always believed that hardowork beats talents and if you work hard enough it will pay off.</p>

          <p>I'm intrigued by how Polaroids camera works and the amazing films it produces. I love the aesthetic look of the picture taken which can't be replicated by any other camera or phone, it truly is one of a kind. My favourite camera is the Polaroid 600 as it produces beautiful big and square photo unlike the Fujifilm or Kodak cameras, however, this can be quite the expensive hobby as each film can go up to $3 per picture.

          <img src="images/volleyball.png" alt=""><!--Image from:https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/Mikasa-Ball-by-polaki/65250816.EJUG5-->
          <p>It is my favourite sport andI always feel excited and have fun while playing. I used to play in school with my friends at the basketball court when I first started out. But now, I have joined a club and play with many others that enjoy the sport like me. As the setter, it always gives me a sense of satisfaction the ball lines up perfectly along my teammates to score easily.

          <p>Usually, me and my friends would hop on a call together to play games and have fun, at this point it is almost like a daily routine. Some may say it is an addiction but nothing else gives such a level of adrenaline whenever we are on the edge of our sits playing to our hearts contents. Sometimes we would even pull all nighters while playing games without even knowing it.</p>
